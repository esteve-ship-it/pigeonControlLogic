Eric Steve (esteve-ship-it)

I am looking into doing some logic control sensing programming. My
major is Electrical and Computer engineering (double major) and this
is my final semester here. I will notify you of any testing of code or
other activities. I will also make sure that the repository is well 
documented and properly merged. 

Devin Farmer

Depending on the direction the project goes, I will need to
learn different skills. One of these could include computer vision
possibly using OpenCV to create control logic for the drone.
Since I have never worked with AI, this will be fun to learn.
I might end up making an app to show what the drone sees and how
it decides what to do. I will be buying the parts so I may end up
buying a pihawk drone kit, or any other drone we deem worthy.
I am ready to code and ready to put stuff together.

George Witt

I am hoping to use my programming skills to further my embedded
programming knowledge as well as learn the practical side of control 
systems. I am an electrical engineering and computer engineering 
major. This is my first semester in WCE. I am going to need to learn 
how to develop AI and gain experience in computer vision in order to
meet these as well as our project's goals.

Tyler Fayta

From the Killer Drone project, I am looking to utilize skills learned
in a practical setting and to continue to improve programming knowledge. 
I am an electrical engineering major, and this is my second semester in 
WCE. I will notify the group of any changes I complete as well as document
notes from the meetings.
