I am looking into doing some logic control sensing programming. My
major is Electrical and Computer engineering (double major) and this
is my final semester here. I will notify you of any testing of code or
other activities. I will also make sure that the repository is well 
documented and properly merged.

I am hoping to use my programming skills to further my embedded
programming knowledge as well as learn the practical side of control 
systems. I am an electrical engineering and computer engineering 
major. This is my first semester in WCE. I am going to need to learn 
how to develop AI and gain experience in computer vision in order to
meet these as well as our project's goals.

From the Killer Drone project, I am looking to utilize skills learned
in a practical setting and to continue to improve programming knowledge. 
I am an electrical engineering major, and this is my second semester in 
WCE. I will notify the group of any changes I complete as well as document
notes from the meetings.
